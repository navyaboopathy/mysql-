
This project is Task 4 from the SQL Developer Internship.

The goal is to use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize and analyze data.

I used a sample employees table with columns: id, name, department, salary, and joining_date.

The script creates the table, inserts sample data, and runs queries using:

SUM to find the total salary per department.

AVG to find the average salary per department.

COUNT to count employees per department.

COUNT(column) to count employees who have a salary value.

HAVING to filter departments with more than two employees.

MAX to find the highest salary in each department.

ROUND to round average salary values.

DISTINCT to count unique departments.

This task helped me understand the difference between WHERE and HAVING,

and how GROUP BY is used to categorize rows before applying aggregate functions.
